The initial dream going into Flatiron was to get a remote position and be able to work anywhere in the world. I am a very outdoorsy person and love going on hikes and adventures on a daily basis with my dog Grizzly. I am currently almost finished building my home on wheels. I converted a 2015 sprinter Into  a mobile home slash office. I hope to be able to travel around the world and work mobily in my van. I put a lot of hard work and time into building the van much like I do with my coding projects.

I custom built all the cabinitry from scratch even the cabinet doors.

I also added a solar system to power my coding needs.

The van is soon to be finished all I need now is to find a remote position to fund the dream!
