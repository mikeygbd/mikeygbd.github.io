At first I thought the bootcamp was going to be very easy and I would be able to breeze through it without any trouble. I was quickly proven wrong when I realized how much time was required to finishing lessons and projects. I was working a full-time job and trying to juggle the bootcamp. I would have to wake up at 5-6 AM every morning and work on my curriculum  till 9 am go to work and then at 7pm after work do my curriculumn untill midnight. This process was very draining. So I found a new way I started taking off monday and tuesday and really just craming 20-30 lessons in each day and then having the rest of the week to work and actually get a good nights rest.
