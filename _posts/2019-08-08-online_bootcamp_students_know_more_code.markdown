So I attended FlatIron Schools hiring event in NYC and It looked like I was only one of two people from my online class. Just from gauging the waiting room there was a lot more people from the brooklyn and NYC campuses there. I was waiting for my second interview when I started a conversation with some students from both the NYC and Brooklyn access labs campuses and they had said they had felt bad for me that I did the online program. I quickly asked them why and was shocked to learn that the in campus students weren't requird to complete any of their lessons. I was in disbelief until two of the students from seperate campuses showed me their curriculumn and they had only completed 4-5 lessons whithin their entire curriculumn. Meanwhile I was required to complete 25-35 lessons each week and then was required to complete the portfolio projects within a weeks time. From my understanding on what the on campus students told me is that they worked on the portfolio project the entire time giving them 3-4 weeks to finish their projects when online students only had a week and had to finish all of their lessons prior to moving on to their projects.
