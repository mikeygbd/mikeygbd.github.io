When thinking of a new project I dont like to think about what others have done. I try and put myself in outher people's shoes and think to myself what would this person need in his/her life. I like to go out to cofee shops, and just sit and do some people watching. I imagine of ways I can make their life better/easier. My favorite place to do this is the airport because their are so many people in need of either some entertainment or some technology to help them cope with their travels. My favorite group of people to watch is the people who do not fly very often because you can tell it on a persons face that they a stressing about the flight or they are frantically rushing to get on the plane and usually have way to much luggage. I think of ways I can make their frantic minds calm down with either an application or a product and then I start designing that product in my mind. I think about the pros and cons and if the pros way out the cons I start writing an outline in my notes otherwise I move on to the next idea.
