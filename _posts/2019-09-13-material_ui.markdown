When I started building my React final project i was reluctant to use a css Framework because I love to design my UI exactly the way I want it. Although I gave it much thought and I knew I was limited on time to work on the project. I knew if I went down the rabit hole of trying to make my project perfect messing around with the css I would loose days and not even realize it. So started searching for the perfect framework and found that material UI was the highest rated one, not to say some of the other frameworks didnt catch my eye. Material UI just seemed very simple to understand and the easiest to work with. I very much liked how you could add your styles directly in the component using the makestyles function like so:

Also one of my favorite things about this framework is if you have to add multiple items to your component you can just chain them in your import like so:

The thing I liked most was the elements they give you are very descriptive in name so you know exactly what element you are inserting and where to find your elements. Take for instance this simple car card I built:

The code Is very descriptive and without building a single component you get something clean like this:

In conclusion If you do not have the time to build out the UI from scratch I highly recommend using material UI.
