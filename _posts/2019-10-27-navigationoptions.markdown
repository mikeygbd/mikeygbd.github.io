Navigation options  is an easy way to customize  your stack navigator and allows to to change the way react navigation behaves and shows your screen. For example if you did not need a header on the screen you can do something like this:

which can be written simpler by just setting it equal to an object like so:

You do not have to assign a function to navigationOptions. Unless you want to make use of a prop within the function like in this case I made use of the navigation prop in order to make use of navigate:
