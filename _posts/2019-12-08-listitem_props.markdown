I wanted to briefly go over list items in react native elements. they are very easy to use with some very accomidating props. first you need to import ListItem from react-native-elements:

Then you need to create a FlatList and return the ListItem something like this but I do have alot of props passed in which i will try and explain :

First off some of the basic props to a flatlist are title and subtile and their styiling props like these:

Chevron just gives you the basic right arrow on the right side of your list item and badge gives you a badge with a number usuall a quanitity of some sort like messages or emails like so:

Then there are props like Linear Gradient and touchable scale which have to be imported seperately:

Linear Gradient give you the ability to change the color gradient in your ListItem giving you a nice fade from left to right giving you something that looks like this:

Touchable scale gives you a much nice touchable opacity giving you all these props to work with:

Giving you a much nicer action button.
