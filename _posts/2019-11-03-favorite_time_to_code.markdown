I have found over the past year that my all time favorite time of the day to code is very early in the morning. I am usually a very early riser and wake up on most days around 6 am. First things first I turn on my Keurig and make myself a hot cup of coffee and on cold mornings I switch on my foot heater to get it warmed up. I drink my coffee and code with my warm toes and I am completely in my comfort zone. I usually do this until 9-10 AM when I have to go to actual work and make money to pay the bills. I find that I get way more done and write way cleaner code first thing in the morning than I do at any other time of day. Most of the time when I have bugs that are stumping me at night I leave them till the morning and am able to figure them out in a minute or two.  I think this is due to my mind and body being freshly rested and not exhausted from coding all morning and manual labor all day.
