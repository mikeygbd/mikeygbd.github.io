This project was very challenging at first because I had to learn a whole new way of reading errors. With the two servers running at the same time it changed my routine at finding what was wrong. I found that a lot of the time looking to the server for errors was sometimes more helpfull than the js console. Also if you restart your server it will give you a list of things that you might be forgetting to do:

This was pretty cool to me because it bassically gave me a code To-do list that I needed to check off. The server expecially helped with the dreaded "Internal Server Error 500" that I have gotten so many times buidling this project. At first I couldnt understand the error and was looking all over for a solution. The console and the host were not describing where the error was coming from but if you looked closely at the server you were able to easily pinpoint the bug. After figuring this out the project was very fun to build. This is something that I wish i knew before I started the project so I hope this helps someone on their future project.
