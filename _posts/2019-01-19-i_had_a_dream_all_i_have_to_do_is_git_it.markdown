Why code?

For a while now I have been coming up with new creative ideas to make everyday a little bit easier with applications that people can use on a daily basis. I went to look into what it would take to make these ideas a reality. I quickly found out that not only was the prices for a quality product extremely expensive but also there was no real way for protecting your ideas. So this is when I had the "Aha" moment that I would just teach myself the skill to create my ideas myself. I quickly started realizing that coding is just problem solving and being able to create something out of nothing. I grew up loving to fix things and was always a big problem solver. I use to take apart electronics as a kid just to understand how they worked and put them back together for fun. My parents hated this ofcourse because they always thought I was just breaking things. Now a days I create these resin river tables on my spare time (Which is very slim these days) and creating a table is very much like puting together a working application in a sense. You have your wood, legs, resin, etc. and you have to figure out how to put them together to form a beautiful/functional product. 

Why now?

I recently had to move closer to my Family to help them out with health and other issues. So in a way I had a violent shove to start a new career. At first coding was a hoby or something I did in my spare time for fun but now that I have fallen in love with code I know I want this to be my life long career.

What's the Inspiration?

The biggest inspiration and motivator I have is the dream of being able to work mobily. This has been a dream of mine for a long time now because my girlfriend, my dog and I love to travel. I recently purchased a mercedes sprinter van that we are hoping to convert into a tiny home so we can go on adventures every day.
