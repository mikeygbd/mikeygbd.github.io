It's not about the goal it's about the journey to the goal and the people you met/your experiences along the way. I didnt have the traditional lifestyle growing up and for that I believe it made me a stronger person. I have more real world experience than most people I know. I have learned a lot more than any school could ever teach me just by experiencing it for myself. For example I now I have the knowledge to build an entire house from scratch, to run an entire farm by myself or the know how to start a business from the ground up. Im sure if I followed the traditional path I would have some high paying desk job by now but I wouldn't have really lived a full life. I have had my ups and downs but I have met some amazing people along the way and gathered some amazing memories/stories.
