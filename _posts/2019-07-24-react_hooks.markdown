When writing react code I tend to prefer to write functional components which gave me the issue of not being able to set the state of any objects. Then Hooks came along and made everything so much easier. Instead of changing your entire component to a class component you can now just insert hooks like so:

This now sets the state of showReviews to false that you can later changed with setShowReviews in an event listener like so:

In conclusion I think this update to react was much needed and makes things way easier if you like writing functional components.
