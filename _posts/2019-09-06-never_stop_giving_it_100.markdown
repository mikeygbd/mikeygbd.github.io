No matter what I am doing in life there is always a part of me that just wants to crawl back into bed and never come out. If I listened to that part of me I would've never accomplished anything in my life. I had to learn how to push through the I will just do it tomorrow mentality. The way I would do this was to think about my futuristic goals and picture them in my head. After I had pictured what I want my life to look like I tell my self I will never have it unless I get this done right now. This usually motivates me to push through those unmotivated moments and get things done ASAP. I also try and eliminate all distractions so I turn my phone off because a simple text from a friend might tell me that its ok to take a break and go grab a cup of coffee with a friend but in all reality you have a deadline to keep and it is not. Last but not least I tell my self If I want to be successful I have to put success first even before breathing. Ok maybe not breathing but I do put it before eating sleeping and having fun. I always challenge my self like if I am hungry to set food as a reward for finishing something that I am working on and if i don't finish I don't eat. I do the same for sleeping, If i am tired I tell myself If I don't finish I don't sleep which usually only allows me to sleep for 3-4 hours each night. As for fun I tell myself you can have fun when you have made it. These three simple methods have literally helped me create my own businesses from the ground up and will continue to do so.
