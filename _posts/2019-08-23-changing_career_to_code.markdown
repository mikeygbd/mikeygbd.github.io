This was a very tuff challenge for me and still is. Not because it wasn't something I was sure I wanted to persue but due to all the surrounding issues it caused. I went from making a very decent living in an industry that was very unstable to making near nothing. It all happened very quickly as I was attending the 5 month program at FlatIron school. As I was studying I was also trying to find  as much little work I could because when u go from making a very good living to nothing you rack up a ton of bills that you use to be able to cover with ease. The toughest challenge for me is the carreer search because Its all about who you know in the industry and for me with my minimum payments each month being more expensive then a luxury appartment in NYC It is tough to afford commute to meet ups. Expecially being that 99% of the meet ups are in NYC and just to commute to the city for one meet up would run me around $100+. Their are still ways to connecting with people online but I feel they are not as effective as actually meeting someone in person and shaking their hand. I am literally fighting each month to not have to claim bankruptcy and at the same time trying to commit as much time as possible to finding a job and making connects.
